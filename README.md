# Deep Q-Network (DQN) for Atari Games

## Project Overview
This project implements the Deep Q-Network (DQN) as proposed by Mnih et al. (2013) for playing Atari games. The primary goal is to understand the DQN architecture, methodology, and practical steps required to replicate the results of their research.

## Running the model
`git clone https://github.com/boemer00/atari-dqn.git`

`cd atari-dqn`

`python src/main.py`
